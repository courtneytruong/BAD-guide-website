          In WvW, gear becomes extremely important to survive. It's also very
          different than PvE gear.
        </p>
        <p>Typically you'll use the following stats:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Healing/support = Minstrel's</li>
          <li>Power DPS = Maurader</li>
          <li>Condition DPS = Celestial</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These stats provide more vitality and sustainability with a slight dps
          trade.

        <h2>Builds</h2>

          These websites provide various builds for WvW. In some cases, you'll
          see different builds for roaming (solo or small group play) and zerg
          (large groups).

          The ideal composition for each 5 person subgroup is to have 1 boon
