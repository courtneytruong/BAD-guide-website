      <h2>What Character Should I Play?</h2>
      <p>
        Play the character you like the best. You will do more for your group
        with a character you enjoy and understand rather than forcing yourself
        into a role you don't enjoy. Everyone is encouraged to try new roles and
        practice those in our events. But you do you.
      </p>
      <h2>Gearing Your Character</h2>
      <h3>Basic gear recommendations:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Full exotic gear (orange color).</li>
        <li>Berserker stats for power DPS, viper stats for condition DPS</li>
        <li>Harrier stats for healing</li>
        <li>Giver/Minstrel stats for tanking (usually done by a healer)</li>
        <li>Ritualist stats for condition support (quickness or alacrity)</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Builds</h2>
      <p className="italic">
        Important note: These websites offer meta builds for various roles and
        game modes. We do not require any of these, though we encourage you to
        explore them if you're looking to improve.
      </p>
      <p>
        These sites use ascended gear and infusions, but exotic gear is fine for
        99% of the game's content. Ascended is only required for agony
        resistance as you level through fractals. The infusions only provide a
        minimal boost and are not necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        These sites also provide explanation of the rotation and how skills and
        traits work together.
