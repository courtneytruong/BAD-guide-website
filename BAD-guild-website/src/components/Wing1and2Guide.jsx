        <h2>Wing 1 - Vale Guardian</h2>
        <p>First Bosses</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Red: Needs condition damage to kill. Summons red orbs that need to
            be knocked back or they'll hurt a lot. Be careful with skills that
            pull targets in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Green: Puts teleporters on the ground that send you away. Avoid
            standing in them - the edges of your screen will turn yellow if you
            are, you'll also hear a humming noise.
          </li>
          <li>
            Blue: Requires boon strips. Has a green circle that requires 4
            people to stand in or it does massive damage.
          </li>
          <li>At 1%, all must be CC'd to kill</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Vale Guardian</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Mixes all of the mechanics described above</li>
          <li>Player with the highest toughness is the tank</li>
          <li>
            Stack tight on the eastern edge of the arena (commander marker),
            there's a crack between two sections
          </li>
          <li>
            A decent healing team will allow you to skip "stand in green"
            mechanic
          </li>
          <li>
            At 66% the first phase happens. 3 condition damage stay left,
            everyone else go right. You will get a color above your head (red on
            left, blue on right) to attack the respective color guardian. Stay
            on your side or be damaged.
          </li>
          <li>
            One person in blue group can pull the green guardian to fight both
            together. If you see green circles, stand in them. Continue watching
            for teleports
          </li>
          <li>
            Same mechanics continue, except now each third of the arena lights
            up one section at a time. If a section lights up do not stand in it
            or die
          </li>
          <li>At 33% the split mechanic happens again, same as above</li>
          <li>
            After guardians are killed stay in the center, just south-west
            (commander marker). Floors will now light up 2 sections at a time
            and you need to move clockwise to avoid floor damage. Stand in
            greens if you can.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Wing 1 - Second "Boss" Event Stuff</h2>
        <p>Spectral Rifts</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Run around area capturing points as they appear on the map, fail to
            capture one and this fails
          </li>
          <li>Fast movement skills, stability, stun breaks are helpful</li>
          <li>
            Adrenal mushrooms can recharge skills (if you have the Heart of
            Thorns mastery)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Spirit Race</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            A massive wall starts to chase you and you need to capture points
            quickly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Everyone should run through points, healers can stay back to capture
            in full
          </li>
          <li>
            DPS should run ahead to help break barrier walls for the team to get
            through
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cemetary</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There are 5 buttons that need to be pushed to move further. Find one
            and stand on it until all are covered
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Wing 1 - Gorseval</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Need gliding updraft</li>
          <li>
            Tank is the person with the highest toughness, turn Gorseval around
          </li>
          <li>Everyone else stay behind to DPS</li>
          <li>
            When he lifts arm and punches down everyone will get knocked down,
            use stability or dodge
          </li>
          <li>
            He will start hitting the ground over and over and green stuff will
            fill the arena. Stay behind and stack tight for heals. Slow CC to
            get more DPS in
          </li>
          <li>
            After breakbar is gone there will be a giant orange circle that
            fills the arena. Break a wall on the outer edge so you can jump off
            the edge and take an updraft to glide back in and avoid dying.
            Everyone jump together
          </li>
          <li>If you get him down to 66% he will skip the above mechanic</li>
          <li>
            4 adds will spawn. If one reaches Gorseval you lose. Commander
            markers help here. Split into two groups. For each group, one person
            focuses on slowing one add to prevent it from getting to the boss
            while the group kills the other and then moves to kill the second
            add.
          </li>
          <li>
            Blue orbs will start spawning around the arena. Nearby orbs should
            be killed. If you touch one, pick up a gold orb to get rid of the
            debuff it gives.
          </li>
          <li>Repeat all steps until 33%</li>
          <li>
            Gorseval now puts red circles on the ground. Avoid red circles or be
            turned into an egg and spam the 1 key
          </li>
          <li>
            You will likely need to escape the arena once here unless DPS is
            great.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Wing 1 - Sabetha</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Kill Sabetha before the platform takes too much damage and wipes you
          </li>
          <li>
            Elect DPS people to be cannon killers - need at least 2 and some
            backups. Throughout the fight they need to step on one of 4 pads and
            a bomber throws the bomb onto the pad to launch them up to kill
            cannons
          </li>
          <li>
            Elect one healer to be flak kiter. They will stay furthest away from
            the boss and get shot at to keep AOE damage off team.
          </li>
          <li>
            Every 45 seconds Sabetha puts down a flamethrower (arrow marker)
            based on where a player is standing. She will spin 360 degrees,
            counter-clockwise. If it touches you you will die. Stay close to
            boss and easily out run it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Players may get red circles around them, spread away from the group
          </li>
          <li>
            Throughout the fight Heavy Bombs will fall on the platform - hit F
            to remove them or the platform takes damage
          </li>
          <li>
            At 75, 50, and 25% bandit champions spawn and Sabetha will leave.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>Second champ, Knuckles, needs to be CC'd</li>
          <li>Third champ puts down flame turrets that should be taken out</li>
          <li>Repeat above mechanics until dead</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div>
        <h2>Wing 2 - Slothasor</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Assign 4 DPS to eat mushrooms and turn into slublings. Slublings can
            be targeted, hurt, and pulled by the team, be careful.
          </li>
          <li>
            Slublings eat red mushrooms to clear poison and make a path to the
            next mushroom
          </li>
          <li>
            Eating mushrooms spawns slubling adds, kill as they get closer - do
            not kill friendly player - pulls works well
          </li>
          <li>
            A purple diamond above your head means Slothasor will chase you -
            keep distance from slubling friends
          </li>
          <li>
            When Slothasor throws a tantrum and hits the ground he creates 3
            blue circles under each persons feet, dodge out of that at the third
            circle
          </li>
          <li>
            When Slothasor leans back he will emit fire breath, don't stand in
            it
          </li>
          <li>
            If you get a green icon above your head you have poison. Run away
            from the group and drop the poison with your special action key,
            preferably where the group is moving from or near the arena edges
          </li>
          <li>Every 20% and at 10% remaining you need to CC the boss</li>
          <li>
            Starting at 50%, the boss will start using a shaking move. You
            should start dodging - condition cleanse is also helpful
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Wing 2 - Bandit Trio</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Split the group into two, one group clears the lower half of the
            area and one group stays up high to clear
          </li>
          <li>
            High group gather any oil barrels and shoot down bee hives, we will
            gather them in a central spot to use later. Drop the item, do not
            use skill buttons.
          </li>
          <li>Don't let enemies kill the prisoner cage or the event fails</li>
          <li>
            Saboteurs will be announced and need to be killed quickly before
            they reach the cage
          </li>
          <li>
            Mortars spawn outside the fort and need to be killed by one DPS
            volunteer
          </li>
          <li>
            Berg spawns around 6:50. Stack together to DPS away from cage. Throw
            bee hives at him and wait to throw more when his bee debuff goes
            away.
          </li>
          <li>
            Zane spawns at 4:55. Stack at south gate to DPS and keep him away,
            standing at the opposite side of the cage so his AOEs don't hit it.
            Open dog cages to help here.
          </li>
          <li>
            Narella spawns at 2:55. Watch for flame thrower and tornadoes. Throw
            oil kegs at her (one at a time).
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Wing 2 - Matthias</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Matthias will get a purple shield bubble around him and reflects are
            required to remove it
          </li>
          <li>
            1 person will get trapped in a crystal - target them (the crystal)
            and use CCs to get them out
          </li>
          <li>
            Matthias will start spinning his staff before shooting a red orb
            that does big damage - dodge or move
          </li>
          <li>
            Players will get a circle around them with a green icon above their
            head. They must head to one of the fountains around the edges to
            cleanse it. If a fountain turns red it has been used and cannot be
            used again - look for blue water. If you don't have the Forsaken
            Thicket Waters mastery you will have a bad time here.
          </li>
          <li>
            Players may also get a circle around them with a special action key.
            This drops a bad field that hurts teammates. Move to the edge of the
            arena and drop it, do not block fountains.
          </li>
          <li>If multiple people get red circles around them spread out</li>
          <li>
            At 40%, Matthias changes and continues to same mechanics. At this
            point ghosts will also start running across the room, don't touch
            them.
          </li>
        </ul>
