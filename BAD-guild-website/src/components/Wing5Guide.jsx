        <h2>Soulless Horror</h2>
        <p>Preparation and things to note:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Two people will tank Souless Horror. Whoever picks up the two
            special action keys will be responsible (two glowing runes on the
            cliffside near boss platform).
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure you know where/how your cc works - if breakbars aren't
            destroyed the raid group dies.
          </li>
          <li>
            Furthermore - refrain from using cc if a tormented dead is nearby
            (it makes the job of the pusher much more difficult).
          </li>
          <li>
            Generally speaking, try to stay behind the boss if you are not the
            active tank - Soulless Horror will apply conditions if you are
            standing in front of her.
          </li>
          <li>
            When a tormented dead is killed, it will leave a large aoe on the
            ground around where it died. This aoe applies conditions and
            corrupts boons. This aoe stays on the ground for about a minute.
          </li>
          <li>
            For this reason, it is encouraged to bring a condition build over a
            power build as these enemies have very low hp and can be bursted
            quickly.
          </li>
          <li>
            The platform shrinks at 90%, 66%, and 33%. Do not be on the edge
            when this happens as you will fall to your dhuum die.
          </li>
          <li>If a flame wall touches you, you will die - avoid these.</li>
          <li>If a scythe touches you, you will have your boons corrupted.</li>
          <li>
            There will be plenty of orange aoe circles/cones as well,
            avoid/dodge these.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Special Roles:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Pusher - You will push the tormented deads (TDs) outside the arena -
            ideally through the group so they can damage it. They will spawn
            every 20 seconds after the first one (roughly 80%-75%). If your team
            is full condi damage, you will want to push the TDs through the boss
            to allow the team to ramp up (if not full condi, these can die very
            quickly, so be ready to adjust your pushing path if needed). Immobs
            can also be very nice to use as well to keep the TD in a desire
            position as you and others are damaging it. Druids and Mechanists
            have an easy time with this and often act as a 3rd healer, but this
            can be done reliably with any class with plenty of
            pushes/displacements (feel free to ask others for assistance
            pushing/immobing). Be careful of pushing through group during
            breakbar phases as hard cc will stop the td from moving.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tank (2) SH - You along with an ally will tank Soulless Horror.
            Prior to starting, interact with the object on the cliff near the
            boss platform. Healers usually do this, but if you are familiar with
            SH's attack patterns you can get away with tanking as any role. This
            will give you a special action key. The special action key will make
            the boss aggro you. The first one of the two tanks to reach the
            platform will aggro the boss first. If you are the first tank, tell
            the second tank to "take" when you hit 3 stacks of Necrosis (this
            debuff continues to apply the longer you have aggro). This call
            means the second tank should use their special action key. After
            that, no more callouts required - just press the SAK after your
            debuff expires! You will also need to move the boss to safe places
            around the platform - do not keep the boss in the center or the edge
            as Tormented Deads and Fire Walls will likely wipe if you are not
            careful.

        <h2>River of Souls</h2>
        <p>Preparation</p>
        <ul>
          <li>There will be two groups, a Desmina group and a front group.</li>
          <li>
            Desmina group will have at least 1 healer (providing consistent
            aegis is a plus!). If you can, have another person bring a scrapper
            to bring permanent superspeed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Everyone else will be in front group (need 1-2 healers for this
            group - quick/alac don't really matter here so shuffle as needed).
          </li>
          <li>
            Encounter starts by talking to Desmina and selecting "Yes, let's
            go."
          </li>
          <li>
            Front group should be on their jackal or raptor mount. When the
            ready check completes, jump forward until they have no more
            endurance down the path (the river will gradually damage everyone).
            The healer should select the option when everyone is down the path.
          </li>
          <li>
            NOTE: If you ever die during the encounter, you will become a
            spirit. As a spirit you will see red orbs. If you collect enough of
            these you will respawn.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Front group:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You will run down the path and kill every enemy that spawns. Healers
            should be providing constant healing throughout, so space your
            skills out to give the maximum amount of healing possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you have only one healer on the group, remember that your healing
            skills will prioritize people in your subgroup, so you may need to
            move people into the same sub or grab an extra healer to prevent
            this.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keep running down the path and killing the enemies until you get to
            the end. All dps players should remain here, and the remaining
            healer(s) should go back to Desmina and assist with keeping her
            healthy.
          </li>
          <li>
            Note that there should be no more than 3 players with Desmina if you
            have someone giving her superspeed. This is because Desmina is
            considered "low priority" for boons, buffs, and healing, so it is
            important to make sure there are not too many players nearby to
            "steal" these important heals and buffs from her.
          </li>
          <li>
            If someone goes down during this, it is usually better to not
            resurrect them and continue on as it can make healing a bit more
            complicated. If it's a healer that's down, res them ASAP.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Desmina group:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You will stay with Desmina and keep her alive. Feel free to have
            someone bring a scrapper for permanent superspeed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Try to stay in the zone around Desmina - this will protect you from
            ticking damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            There will be rifts that appear along the path. They are destroyed
            by the number of times hit, so skills that hit multiple times are
            best (druid staff can hit 3 times per auto for example).
          </li>
          <li>
            These rifts will try to pull you off the road, try to stay on the
            path!
          </li>
          <li>
            These rifts will spawn small enemies that will damage Desmina. If
            you have a scrapper bringing permanent superspeed, these can be
            ignored. Otherwise, minimize the amount of small enemies that spawn
            by destroying the rifts as mentioned above. They can be destroyed by
            auto-attacking them (make sure to equip a ranged weapon!)
          </li>
          <li>
            If you ever get an orange/yellow aoe circle, keep it off Desmina. It
            will eventually stop following you and start filling red - get off
            this circle. This will damage and knock you down.
          </li>
          <li>
            There will be flame walls very similar to the Soulless Horror fight
            that goes across the road around Desmina. You will instantly die if
            this wall touches you. Note: Desmina is unaffected by this wall.
          </li>
          <li>
            There will be enemies that spawn and walk into Desmina - they will
            explode and deal damage to everyone in the aoe indicator.
          </li>
          <li>
            Give Desmina aegis to minimize the amount of damage she takes from
            this. There will be plenty of enemies that explode so make sure you
            have plenty of aegis/healing!
          </li>

        <h2>Statues of Grenth</h2>
        <p>
          Getting there: After you finish River of Souls, you will need to
          complete 3 separate events in order to unlock Dhuum's arena (east,
          climb the ramp on the platform). Statue of Ice is north on a cliff,
          Statue of Death is to the south on a platform, and Statue of Darkness
          is underneath Dhuum's arena east (There will be two separate cave
          entrances you can take). A flying mount is very helpful for
          navigating, but a friend with turtle mount, warclaw, jackal with bond
          of vigor, or a springer will be enough.
        </p>
        <h2>Statue of Ice (a.k.a. "Broken King")</h2>
        <p>Preparations and general strategy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fight starts when someone stands in a green orb.</li>
          <li>
            Whoever has the highest toughness is the tank. Keep the boss facing
            north away from the rest of the group.
          </li>
          <li>
            Every time the boss loses 2% hp, a green circle will appear, which
            indicates an icicle dropping. If no one stands in this circle to
            absorb the attack, then everyone in the raid will take massive
            damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            For this reason, it is important that your group does not dps too
            quickly as too many green circles will be impossible to collect.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is everyone's job to stand in green circles. If someone is
            already occupying a green circle find a different one!
          </li>
          <li>
            Whenever a player successfully absorbs an icicle, they will get a
            stack of Frozen Wind. If you get 3 stacks, stop collecting. Stacks
            timeout after 45 seconds. If you collect a 4th one, you will be
            frozen and start taking tons of damage for 10 seconds. You will
            instantly die if your hp drops to 0 while frozen.
          </li>
          <li>Do not stand in cracks on the ground, they hurt real bad.</li>
          <li>
            Do not stand too close to the boss, or directly in front of the
            tank, he will hurt you real bad.
          </li>
          <li>
            This encounter has a hard enrage timer (3:30), meaning failure to
            defeat this boss in the alloted time will result in instant defeat.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Statue of Death (a.k.a. "Eater of Souls")</h2>
        <p>Preparations and general strategy:</p>
        <li>Fight starts when someone walks towards the middle.</li>
        <li>
          Have the subgroup that does NOT have the tank be in charge of greens,
          and assign one dps person to sacrifice (we will come back to this).
        </li>
        <li>
          Whoever has the highest toughness is the tank. You will notice 4
          rectangular etchings on the ground with 5 circles inside of them -
          these are the dominos. Take the boss to the green domino and don't
          move it off until it spits out red orbs into the air.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is worth noting that Eater of Souls will not die until all 6
          torches above the sand portal are lit, any attempt to kill him before
          then will result in him regenerating all his hp.
        </li>
        <li>Watch out for puke, it hurts real bad.</li>
        <li>
          After a short period of time a spider will spawn, killing this causes
          5 yellow orbs to appear in the center.
        </li>
        <li>
          Collect one yellow orb and use your special action key to throw it on
          the glowing green domino (tank should have boss on top of it), note
          that you should refrain from collecting more until you dispose of the
          first orb you collected.
        </li>
        <li>
          When an orb hits the domino, the circles will start to glow. When all
          five orbs are glowing, "kill" Eater of Souls. He will regerate his hp,
          however, red orbs will launch in the air.
        </li>
        <li>
          Do this process twice, then have the subgroup in charge of greens take
          the next one.
        </li>
        <li>
          A spirit will spawn in between one of the four domino pieces every 50
          seconds. A pop-up will appear about 10 seconds beforehand, make sure
          you go to your spot asap (it will be marked with a shield icon).
        </li>
        <li>
          Whoever is in charge of sacrificing should fly over to where Eater of
          Souls is and wait. He will do an attack that should suck you into his
          hitbox almost immediately.
        </li>
        <li>
          This makes it so we can effectively "skip" this mechanic as you will
          be downstate hopefully next to the tank.
        </li>
        <li>Remaining people need to collect 5 red orbs.</li>
        <li>
          Every 4 orbs collected will light 1 torch above the sand portal. If
          all 4 remaining people collect their orbs, then all torches should be
          lit.
        </li>
        <li>
          If no one takes a green, then there will be a shockwave, which will
          blow out a torch if at least one was lit.
        </li>
        <li>
          NOTE: If you go up to collect red orbs, you will get a debuff. Do not
          take a green if you have this debuff as you will be instantly killed.
          The debuff expires after 90 seconds.
        </li>
        <li>At this point, one of two things will happen:</li>
        <li>
          If everyone returns and all of the torches aren't lit, continue the
          pattern of killing spiders, throwing yellow orbs on green dominoes,
          and "killing" Eater of Souls on top of them until you do. At this
          point it is okay to have whomever take greens as long as it is not the
          tank and the person does not have the debuff.
        </li>
        <li>
          If all the torches are lit, he is now able to be killed for real. Stop
          whatever you are doing and kill Eater of Souls ASAP.
        </li>

        <h2>
          Statue of Darkness (a.k.a. "Eye of Judgement" and "Eye of Fate")
        </h2>
        <p>Preparations and general strategy:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fight starts when a light orb is collected.</li>
          <li>
            Have one subgroup go north and stack behind the wall near Eye of
            Judgement, and have the other stack south behind the wall near Eye
            of Fate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Have one non-healer from both subs go up to the platform that splits
            the two sections (Where all the light orbs are). They will be in
            charge of throwing orbs to your group.
          </li>
          <li>Pressing weapon skill 1 while holding the orb will throw it.</li>
          <li>
            Make sure they have plenty of mobility as they will need to run back
            and forth in order to properly throw orbs to their group. They will
            also need to deal with light thieves that spawn. Ideally, this
            person will also have some tankiness either inherently or sustain
            through traits/gear since they will not have a dedicated healer with
            them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure one person is lieutenant in both subgroups so they can
            mark their eye with a marker.
          </li>
          <li>
            When the fight starts, the lieutenant will need to target their
            respective eye and use the relevant squad marker (default command is
            Alt+Shift+1 - note that "1" can be replaced with any number 1-8. 9
            will clear all markers.
          </li>
          <li>
            For ease, have north sub mark with arrow (alt+shift+1), and south
            sub mark with circle (alt+shift+2)
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not have an orb thrower do this as they will not be close enough
            to mark the target.
          </li>
          <li>
            Have the healers be in charge of stunning their respective eyes with
            light orbs.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you are not in charge of stunning the eye refrain from using
            fears, dazes, or knockdowns as this will overwrite the orb's stun.
            The orb's stun is stronger than any other stun available to you.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the eye is no longer stunned it will teleport somewhere else,
            follow it and repeat the process. Make sure the orb thrower is
            throwing in the new location.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid placing lightning fields as well as some combo finishers apply
            daze!
          </li>
          <li>
            While holding the orb, make sure you are next to the eye and press
            weapon skill 2 - this will consume the orb and cause the eye to be
            stunned, allowing it to be damaged. If you have any traits or
            sigils, this stun will last longer. Be ready to do this again before
            the stun wears off (pay attention to the target's hotbar for this
            debuff).
          </li>
          <li>
            Both eyes need to die within 15 seconds of one another, or else it
            will regenerate hp and teleport again.

            There are a few special roles for this encounter. You will need 3
            different people assigned to the "Green" mechanic. Have a dps player
            take the first green. Whoever takes green two will also be assigned
            to kite Dhuum's Messengers. Whoever takes green three will tank
            Dhuum. More information on these special roles can be found in the
            special roles section below.
          </li>
          <li>
            Place a marker on each of the seven points in the arena (use graphic
            in the special roles section as reference).
          </li>
          <li>
            Fight starts when someone interacts with Desmina and selects the
            appropriate dialogue option.
          </li>
          <li>
            Have this be the kiter. Rest of group should stack either northeast
            or southeast in the arena (Usually groups stack somewhere near
            square).
          </li>
          <li>
            There is a constant damaging pulse throughout the fight. This does
            relatively low damage, but make sure to stay near healers to keep
            hp% high.

        <p>Strategy:</p>
        <p>"Pre-event"</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            There is a two minute "pre-event" where you must kill enforcers that
            spawn around the arena. Dhuum will be on his throne, and he will not
            be targetable during this point.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enforcers will walk towards the nearest reaper and deal massive
            damage. If any of these reapers die, it will be a wipe.
          </li>
          <li>
            If at any point you get too close to the throne (up the small ramp),
            you will be instantly killed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enforcers will appear throughout the fight at each of the corners of
            the arena, starting at Square. They will continue to spawn clockwise
            (Spiral, Arrow, Circle, Square, etc.).
          </li>
          <li>
            Unless you are the kiter, avoid hitting the mesesengers. They will
            follow whoever hit them for around 10 seconds. They will die
            afterwards. These enemies are immune to damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Every thirty seconds, a green will appear, starting at 9:30 and
            continuing every 30s after. If there is no one in the green, the
            reaper will die and there will be a raid wipe. Here is a brief
            breakdown of each of the special roles from another guide!
          </li>
          <li>
            For greens, it is important to note that you have 15 seconds to
            collect 5 orbs, or else you die. A better breakdown of the mechanic
            can be found on this Youtube video.
          </li>
          <li>
            At around 9 minutes, someone at random will get a special action
            key.
          </li>
          <li>
            This is a bomb, do not press this ever. It will detonate on it's own
            so stay away from the group and kiter. You must also be aware of
            where the kiter and where the green goers are located, as you could
            down them. Damage is proximity based, so the closer someone is to
            you, the more damage they will receive.

        <p>Main Fight (Dhuum cont.)</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Non-tanks need to avoid getting hit by Dhuum's swipe attack. Staying
            behind him and inside his hitbox is great to receive optimal boons
            and take minimal damage.
          </li>
          <li>Avoid any aoe circles, and avoid standing in cracks</li>
          <li>
            Tank should try not deviate from tanking path. Generally, tank
            should try to keep boss facing the nearest wall. You will only move
            the boss only when he does the "dip" attack.
          </li>
          <li>
            Small dip: Dhuum will dip into the ground and reappear on a random
            player and create a large orange circle. STAY OUT OF THIS CIRCLE. If
            you are hit by/step in it you will be separated from your soul (you
            will be knocked backwards and need to collect it or you will die).
          </li>
          <li>
            Big dip: At 6:25, 5:05, 3:45, 2:25, and 1:05, Dhuum will dip into
            the ground and reappear in the center, and blast the squad backwards
            out of their bodies and also steal their boons. The squad should
            have their backs to the nearest wall facing the center beforehand to
            minimize the time it takes to get their soul back. Also, everyone
            gets 6 stacks of torment so condi cleanse is a must. You should run
            to the light you see (originates from where you were initially
            knocked back) to get your soul back. Afterwards, run away from Dhuum
            - he will be pulling everyone into him, stay out of the red circle
            under Dhuum or take lots of damage. Group can reposition properly
            after the suck concludes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tank path is as follows: Arrow {"->"} Spiral {"->"} Center (after
            Dhuum suck) {"->"} Circle {"->"} Square (after Dhuum suck) {"->"}{" "}
            Star {"->"} ???
          </li>
          <li>
            During small dips, tank can move immediately. During big dips, tank
            should wait to position after the suck is complete.
          </li>
          <li>
            If there are any enforcers, have the non-tank subgroup go and deal
            with it. After 8 minutes, they should only spawn if a green misses a
            specific orb (the big one)
          </li>
          <li>
            At 60% the two closest non-tanks to Dhuum will be linked together
            (often called chains, shackles, or lightning). They will need to run
            away from one another or take massive damage. Damage scales higher
            the closer they are. This will persist through downstate, so it is
            very important to move ASAP.
          </li>
          <li>
            At 10% HP, the timer resets to 1:45, Dhuum goes invulnerable, and
            everyone will need to collect orbs. Each player has 30s in order to
            collect 5 orbs or else they die. When each player has done so, they
            will be teleported underneath Dhuum. There will be 7 seals (located
            where reapers were at previously) that players need to run to and
            channel. The arena will do a lot more damage outside of the center
            so it is recommended to make sure you have boons on you before you
            run out.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can have the commander use a ready check to coordinate when to
            go. Have people face towards a seal, and hit ready when they are in
            position. If anyone is dead, have them hit ready immediately.
            Alternatively, you can assign people which seal to go to before you
            start the encounter.
          </li>
          <li>
            It is important to make sure that everyone goes at the same time! If
            all seals aren't fully channeled, they all will reset and will need
            to be re-channeled.
          </li>
          <li>
            After 20s, Dhuum will become untargetable again. Run back to the
            seal you channelled initially ASAP, no ready check required.
