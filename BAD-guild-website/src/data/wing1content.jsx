        "For Vale Guardian: There are multiple ways to approach this, but its most important that you keep the boss as still as you can while avoiding the teleport mechanic. You will also be grabbing the green guardian during the split phase and bringing it to the group at blue (hit him to grab aggro)",
        "For Gorseval: Make sure you bring plenty of stability/aegis as the boss and enemies will make frequent attempts to hit you with knockdowns/pushes. Make sure to face Gorseval away from your allies, and to keep him still during all phases. You will need to move a bit when Gorseval channels any of his attacks (mainly cc bar and eggs) - just reposition yourself appropriately and return to your original position once his attack finishes.",
        "Flak Kiter - You will keep Sabetha's Flak off the group. You can stand at range somewhere between the center and edge of the platform, staying generally around the southeast side. Alternatively, you can run out to be targeted by flak if you are familiar with Sabetha's attack chain (shoots twice then fires flak). Bring a blink for firewall if needed. Do not block access to the cannon platforms (keep the flak out of the path of the cannon goers).",
        "Cannons (2) - You will be launched at one of the four platforms throughout the fight, and destroy a cannon firing on the platform. Consider using a blink. You and the other cannon person will alternate launch platforms. Someone will be launched approximately every thirty seconds. The platform you will be launched from will follow this set pattern: South(1), East(2), North (1), West 2), South(1), North(2), East(1), West(2), Repeat",

If there is, everyone should wait in place for it to explode and heal to 100% before going to their respective pylons. During this phase, the north group should be standing in the greens (minimum four). If you don’t, the condi DPS at red will be very sad and probably get downed. Run back to arrow after the phase is over.",

            "33% split phase: Same as 66%. Run to circle after the phase is over. The reason we go to circle is because the bottom/red third of the arena will always be safe after this phase is over, and since we have to rotate constantly it is easier to rotate sections around halfway up the split line instead of at the edge.",

I’ve seen people send one subgroup north and one south, and I’ve seen groups just stay as 10 and move to each blue rift as one. In terms of actually completing the event early, it makes no difference as the blue rifts are on a timer that isn’t affected by how quickly they are completed. Personally, I prefer to have the group move as 10 because the blue rift progress bar fills up based on how many people are standing in it, and this scales to 10 people so if all 10 are standing in it it finishes very quickly. You can easily do the other way though if that is your preference. ",

Don’t stand in the blue goop because it will do damage and apply 25 stacks of vulnerability when it explodes.

To cleanse this you will have to kill a blue orb and pick up the two golden orbs that spawn. Call out the slow CC when it appears and break it around ~43%.",

Keep the squad stacked tightly so these can be easily sidestepped. Depending on if anyone has died or group DPS, break the last CC bar around 10-15%. If group DPS is very low, you may have to break a wall after the CC bar is broken, and glide to an updraft and back to the platform. The updrafts are marked on the map.
