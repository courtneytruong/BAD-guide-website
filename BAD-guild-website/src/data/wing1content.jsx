            "One person in blue group can pull the green guardian to fight both together. If you see green circles, stand in them. Continue watching for teleports",

        "4 adds will spawn. If one reaches Gorseval you lose. Commander markers help here. Split into two groups. For each group, one person focuses on slowing one add to prevent it from getting to the boss while the group kills the other and then moves to kill the second add.",
