        " Tower group - a mesmer, or a dps and healer, should go through the tunnel. Forsaken Thicket Waters and Ley-line Gliding mastery is needed from those volunteers. Run through the tunnel, splash in puddles and get up the tower. Kill all but one mob and capture the tower.",

        "Adds will spawn with a color above their head, kill the ones that match the same color above your head. This mechanic may be skipped if you kill statues fast enough on boss.",
        "If the group gets red circles, spread out.",
        "If you see a pink circle around Keep Construct, don't stand in it.",
        "After killing statues on the boss you will see a CC bar. Once you CC successfully he will go away and the group needs to split up on 3 green circles that appear (commander markers). Each circle needs at least 2 people or the raid fails.",
        "It's helpful to designate one circle for DPS. Anyone tethered to a statue should go to the DPS group to quickly kill.",
        "After green circles, assign one person to push an orb around the arena and push it through rifts. If the ball hits the outside it's over. If mobs catch the orb it's over. More rifts means more damage in the next phase. Everyone else kill statue spawns.",

        "Time to fight Xera. Well placed commander markers make this easy to move the group around and avoid bad stuff.",
        "Start near center and DPS, everyone but tank stay behind Xera. Giant pink walls will appear and will hurt you if standing in them. Once those fade away move to south-east of platform. If you're not quick a laser will strike you in the center.",

        "Back to near center of platform to fight. After walls no north-west.",

Those 3 need to spread out away from the group (commander markers). If a person with a red circle goes down you can safely res them but need to move as soon as they're up",
