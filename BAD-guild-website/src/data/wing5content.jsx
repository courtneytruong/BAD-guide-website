They will spawn every 20 seconds after the first one (roughly 80%-75%). If your team is full condi damage, you will want to push the TDs through the boss to allow the team to ramp up (if not full condi, these can die very quickly, so be ready to adjust your pushing path if needed). Immobs can also be very nice to use as well to keep the TD in a desire position as you and others are damaging it. Druids and Mechanists have an easy time with this and often act as a 3rd healer, but this can be done reliably with any class with plenty of pushes/displacements (feel free to ask others for assistance pushing/immobing). Be careful of pushing through group during breakbar phases as hard cc will stop the td from moving.",

Healers usually do this, but if you are familiar with SH\'s attack patterns you can get away with tanking as any role. This will give you a special action key. The special action key will make the boss aggro you. The first one of the two tanks to reach the platform will aggro the boss first. If you are the first tank, tell the second tank to "take" when you hit 3 stacks of Necrosis (this debuff continues to apply the longer you have aggro). This call means the second tank should use their special action key. After that, no more callouts required - just press the SAK after your debuff expires! You will also need to move the boss to safe places around the platform - do not keep the boss in the center or the edge as Tormented Deads and Fire Walls will likely wipe if you are not careful.',
