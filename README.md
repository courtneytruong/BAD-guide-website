# BAD-guide-website

This project is a reactjs + tailwindcss website built for The BAD Guild a Guild Wars 2 community. The website was builtto house guide content for in game encounters written by community members and display it in an easier to read format. Currently the guides are housed in individual discord forum threads within the guilds discord. The website was built to create a potential solution to the clunkiness of discord forum threads and for me to practice my react and tailwindcss skills in a useful and real world situation.
